The spatial distribution of a hypothetical density function for every point in a forested area is represented as a wavy piecewise constant green surface. Sample plots (white dots) inform the inventorist of the value of the density function at that point. Note that the plateaus of constant $Y(x)$ values here have the shape of squares whereas in reality they are likely to be formed by the intersection of circles around trees.\relax }}{11}{figure.caption.9}
