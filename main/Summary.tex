% overall objective & research question:
The objective of this thesis was to contribute methods for incorporation of auxiliary information derived from remote sensing data in existing forest inventory procedures with focus on practical implementation and application. It was thereby of particular interest to explore if a combination with auxiliary data can enable the use of terrestrial data from large scale forest inventories for estimation on much smaller spatial levels while still providing sufficient estimation precision. In this research framework, two approaches for small area estimation were closer investigated.\par

% db sae:
The first approach comprised the application of design-based small area regression estimators and was tested in a case study carried out in the German federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate. The objective of the study was to develop a double-sampling procedure for the German National Forest Inventory (NFI) and evaluate whether the implied combination of remote sensing data and the terrestrial NFI data can provide sufficient estimation precision for timber volume estimation on two small-scale forest district levels. The work on this study is presented in three subsequent chapters: the first chapter gives a comprehensive review of design-based small area regression estimators and demonstrates their implementation in a statistical software package that was developed for the purpose of this study. The second chapter addresses three major challenges that occurred during the identification of a suitable timber volume regression model to be used in the estimators. These challenges comprised the occurrence of time-gaps between the terrestrial survey date and the acquisition of auxiliary data, the optimal derivation of explanatory variables under unknown spatial extent of a terrestrial sample location due to angle count sampling, and incorporation of tree species information derived from satellite image classification as additional predictor variable including the treatment of misclassifications. The third chapter finally illustrates the implementation of the small area estimation procedure and evaluate its potential by comparing the estimation precisions to those derived under one-phase sampling, i.e. exclusively using the terrestrial NFI data available within each management unit. It was found that the application of the design-based small area regression estimators led to a reduction of the variance by 43\% and 25\% (estimation errors of 5\% and 11\%) on average on the two forest district levels compared to the one-phase estimator. The results thus confirmed that the design-based regression estimators show great potential for NFI data to be additionally used for estimation on small scale management units. Increasing time-gaps between terrestrial survey and the auxiliary data acquisition led to a pronounced residual inflation which however could be mitigated by including the acquisition date as categorical predictor in the regression model. Additionally, the main tree species of a sample plot revealed to be a powerful predictor that can improve prediction performance when combined with vegetation height information. By introducing a calibration technique it was also possible to neutralize a further residual inflation caused by the effect of tree species misclassifications on the regression model coefficients. Using categorical information such as quality and tree species information in the regression model extended the approach to double-sampling for regression within post-strata, which has been a well-known and effective means to reduce the variance of estimates.\par

% mapping:
The second approach comprised the application of model-dependent mapping where the target area, i.e. a map cell, corresponds to the extent of a sample plot and thus exclusively comprises one model prediction.
As such maps provide predictions in very high spatial resolution, they support the location of forest management activities on very small scales. This imposes high requirements on the precision of the estimates. Focussing on predictions maps for continuous forest attributes, the objective was thus to investigate an additional means to address the precision for each map cell. This was approached by calculating the user's accuracy, as known from classification accuracy assessment techniques, for prediction value intervals using terrestrial inventory data located within the mapping area as reference data. In this framework, an optimization algorithm was developed to automatically divide the prediction range into intervals of minimal width and highest possible estimation precision while at the same time ensuring statistically sound properties of the underlying error matrix. The methods were tested on a timber volume map for a mountainous study site in Switzerland using data from the regional forest inventory as validation data. The results provided evidence that the prediction errors associated to specific value intervals are often considerably larger than expected from metrics describing the overall prediction model performance. The suggested validation method thus provides an additional accuracy metric that can be easily calculated and improves the information about the accuracy provided by forest attribute maps. The optimization method can additionally be used to identify prediction intervals that reflect the potentially varying performance of the underlying prediction model across the prediction range.
