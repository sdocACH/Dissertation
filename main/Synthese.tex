\section{Main findings}
\label{sec:synth:mainfind}

% ----------------------------------------- %
% * study 3 - estimations:
The investigated design-based small area regression estimators show great potential for the German NFI data to be additionally used for estimation of forest attributes on forest district levels. In the case study presented in this thesis, the variance for the estimation of timber volume on two district levels was reduced by 43\% and 25\% on average by the unbiased regression estimators compared to the one-phase estimator exclusively using the terrestrial inventory data. The results thus strongly support the findings of similar studies from other countries that the precision of estimates based on national forest inventory data on regional scales can be considerably improved if the terrestrial inventory data are combined with remote sensing data in the framework of small area estimation techniques. It was also empirically confirmed that the synthetic estimator who neglects the prediction performance of the regression model produces considerably smaller variances and confidence intervals compared to the estimates of the unbiased estimators. In addition to their potential design-bias, this strongly suggests that synthetic estimates are over-optimistic and should be treated with caution. The application of design-unbiased estimators provides the advantage of not having to rely on the validity of the prediction model and should thus be preferred to synthetic estimation whenever it is possible. Fitting the regression model used in the estimators internally seems obvious if the terrestrial inventory phase provides sufficient data for modelling. This is most likely the case if the terrestrial inventory phase is a national forest inventory covering large areas and diverse forest structures. In case the regression model is fitted internally, providing the g-weight variance is preferable to the external variance since it accounts for the dependency of the regression coefficients on the realized sample.\par

% , yielding estimation errors of 5\% and 11\% on average respectively.

% ----------------------------------------- %
% * study 2 - modelling:
Whereas calculating the g-weight variance restricts the internal model of the estimators to OLS regression, it was demonstrated that OLS modelling possibilities provide sufficient flexibility to reflect real world dependencies between predictor and response variables and also to mitigate residual inflations caused by quality restrictions in the auxiliary data. If the quality of auxiliary data varies between known strata, including these strata as categorical predictors in the regression model can be an effective means to improve the model precision. Among the auxiliary variables for timber volume prediction, the main tree species of a sample plot revealed to be a powerful predictor when combined with vegetation height information that can be used to boost prediction performance. If categorical data such as tree species information is derived from classification of remote-sensing data and thus prone to classification errors, the calibration technique suggested in this thesis provides a simple and effective method to remove the bias in the regression coefficients caused by misclassifications and thereby increase the model precision. Using categorical variables including their interactions with other categorical or continuous predictors in the regression model thereby extends double-sampling for regression to post-stratification, which is a well-known and effective means to reduce the variance of estimates.\par

% ----------------------------------------- %
% * study 4 - mapping:
The investigated mapping scenario constitutes a special case of small area estimation where the target area, i.e. a map cell, corresponds to the extent of a sample plot and thus exclusively comprises one model prediction. In the case of prediction maps for continuous response variables, the suggested approach of calculating the user's accuracy for prediction value intervals according to accuracy assessment techniques constitutes an alternative way of providing a confidence interval for each map cell. A difference to classical regression prediction intervals is that the confidence level for the intervals can vary between map cells instead of being fixed. This seems more appropriate for practical usage as it provides the map user with precisions associated to self-defined map value intervals opposed to providing him with map value intervals based on a fixed confidence level. The proposed optimization method can additionally be used to automatically identify prediction intervals that provide highest possible confidence levels while ensuring statistically sound properties of the underlying error matrix.

\section{Limitations and criticisms}
\label{sec:synth:limits}
% 




% - design-based estimators in general:
%  * cluster sampling --> my judgement
%    -> is known to increase the variance of estimates (cluster correlation coeff). More for state than for change estimation (intra cluster correlation for state higher than for change)
%    -> extpsynth under cluster sampling -> violation (recommendation psmall vs. extpsynth)
%  * g-weight variance restricted to OLS regression --> outlook: others models combined with external variance --> hint at Alex Diss
%  * design-based estimators rely on randomization of sample locations, but are applied to systematic grids. 
%    -> tends to overestimate (safe side)
%    -> not neglecting would imply the application of model-dependent estimation techniques. Here, geostatistical double-kriging as proposed by Mandallaz (1993) would
%       provide an estimation method that offers a statistically sound incorporation of the spatial correlation
%  * critical sample sizes n2G in small area --> rule of thumb?
%    -> evidence from case study: a threshold of n2G > 6, but at least > 4 ()
%    -> theoretical considerations: simulations, dependency of coverage rates on n2G (Daniel)

% - practical implementation of double-sampling with special application to SAE:
%  * forest definition (mask vs. field decision) 
%  * boundary adjustment at small area borders
%

% - modelling:
%  * time-lags between terrestrial survey and acquisition of the auxiliary data 
%    -> minimize or avoid time-lags in order to ensure optimal model precision 
%    -> especially important for change estimation
%    -> time-lags could be accounted for in state estimation, but has more limiting effects especially in the case of change estimation (ref to Diss Alex)
%  * angle-count sampling implies the problem that the extraction of the auxiliary information cannot be matched to an exact spatial extent in which the terrestrial data was gathered
%    -> 

% - mapping:
%  * opt. method is a heuristic: 
%    -> output for same input data can vary according to parameterization (cooling scheme) and randomization part  
%    -> no exact solution, rather finds solution close to the optimum
%  * even the user's accuracies that serve as confidence levels for the prediction intervals are themselves associated with uncertainties caused by the sampling of reference data.

% Design-based SAE in RLP:
%
% - use of systematic grids in practice treated as uniformly randomly distributed sample locations. In the strict sense, this is a violation of the design-based inference assumptions. Reassuringly, simulations have indicated that this leads in most cases to a overestimation of the variance and thus conservative estimates of the estimation errors. [Geostatistic ...]
%
% - practical implementation of double-sampling with special application to SAE: 
%   + forest definition (mask vs. field decision) 
%   + theoretically, boundary adjustment (both on aux. data and field) should be performed also at the boundaries of a SAE unit. For the field inventory, this is at the moment not done, since sae ds estimation has not yet been a implemented part of the National Forest Inventory. (It was consequently also not done for the aux.data in our study). Performing boundary adjustment also at the sa-borders would imply an increased effort in the field inventory as well as an considerable increase in data storage. Neglecting the badj at the sa-borders simplify things, but the implications have yet not been tested. This could be a topic for future work. [When would negclecting be a problem?].  
% 
% - time-lags between terrestrial survey and acquisition of the auxiliary data
%  * 
%
% - angle-count sampling hampers the derivation of auxiliary data since the exact extent around a sample location in which information was gathered cannot be determined
%
% - unbiasedness comes to the price of providing a minimum number of terrestrial observations in a small area. Regarding the question about a sufficient number, the case study indicated that sample sizes in a small area $\leq 5$ can result in large estimation errors when combined with moderate and poor model fits. [Additionally ...]. These considerations suggest a minimum sample size of at least 6 observations per small area. However, this number is likely not met for ...\% of the FR districts and can surely not be provided on smaller spatial scales such as forest stands
%   If estimations on these scales are still requested, it might be inevitable to increase the sampling frequency of the terrestrial inventory or apply model-dependent estimators. The disadvantage of model-dependent estimators however ...
